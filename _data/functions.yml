limited-suid:
  label: Limited SUID
  description: |
    It runs with the SUID bit set and may be exploited to access the file system, escalate or maintain access with elevated privileges working as a SUID backdoor. If it is used to run commands it only works on systems like Debian (<= Stretch) that allow the default `sh` shell to run with SUID privileges.

    This example creates a local SUID copy of the binary and runs it to maintain elevated privileges. To exploit an existing SUID binary skip the first command and run the program using its original path.
